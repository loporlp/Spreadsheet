# Comments to Evaluators:

I have no comments for Evaluators

# Assignment Specific Topics
This project contains one public
static class named "Evaluate" that takes in an Infix statement ex "(1 + 5) * 6" 
and returns the solution, for the example Evaluate would return 36, can also take in Variables
with a lookup object and will be able to produce an answer, if an invalid token is passed through
an ArgumentException will be thrown
