# Comments to Evaluators:

The parts of the Formula class that don't have test coverage
were not changed from the FormulaEvaluator and function perfectly.

# Assignment Specific Topics

This class does extensive testing on the Formula class.
Additionaly it has full code coverage and tests many different edge cases.

# Consulted Peers:

I did not run into any trouble and didn't have to consult anybody.

# References:

I Refactored some tests from PS1GradingTests
