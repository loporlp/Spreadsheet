# Comments to Evaluators:

For our extra feature we have a button in the file menu that lets you change the 
color of the spreadsheet, Maui doesn't let the color update unsless you highlight over it

# Assignment Specific Topics

This GUI fully implements the Spreadsheet Class to allow a fully working spreadsheet that
can open from a file save to a file and even change the color, it gives warnings when CircularExceptions or
FormulaExceptions are thrown and resets the Spreadsheet to the last working model.

# Consulted Peers:

I did not run into any trouble and didn't have to consult anybody.
